## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/toowiredd/claude-skills-automation
cd claude-skills-automation

# Install (to test hooks)
bash scripts/install.sh

# Make changes
# Test thoroughly
# Submit PR
```

### Testing Changes

1. **Test hooks locally**:
   ```bash
   # Test manually
   echo '{"session_id":"test","cwd":"'$PWD'"}' | hooks/session-start.sh
   ```

2. **Test in Claude Code**:
   - Install your changes
   - Start new Claude Code session
   - Verify automation works
   - Check logs: `tail -f ~/.claude-memories/automation.log`

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**Bash Scripts**:
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Add logging to automation.log
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add comments for complex logic

**Example**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Description of what this hook does

set -euo pipefail

LOG_FILE="/home/toowired/.claude-memories/automation.log"

log() {
  echo "[$(date -Iseconds)] [HookName] $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

main() {
  log "Hook starting..."

  # Hook logic here

  log "Hook complete"
  exit 0
}

main
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding features
- Add comments in code
- Update relevant docs/ files
- Include examples

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:
```
feat: add new decision extraction pattern
fix: resolve memory index corruption issue
