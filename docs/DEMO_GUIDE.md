## üìê Best Practices

### Recording Settings

**Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
**Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
**Duration**: 30-90 seconds (attention span)
**File Size**: <10MB for GIFs, <50MB for videos

### Terminal Settings

```bash
# Increase font size for visibility
# In your terminal preferences:
Font Size: 14-16pt
Font: Monospace (e.g., Fira Code, JetBrains Mono)

# Use clear prompt
export PS1="\[\e[32m\]$ \[\e[0m\]"

# Slow down typing for readability
# Use 'pv' to simulate typing:
echo "command here" | pv -qL 20  # 20 chars/second
```

### Content Guidelines

1. **Start with title card** (3 seconds)
   - Show: "Claude Skills Automation Demo"
   - Subtitle: What this demo shows

2. **Clear, deliberate actions** (45-60 seconds)
   - Type slowly enough to read
   - Pause after important outputs
   - Highlight key information

3. **End with summary** (5 seconds)
   - Show result achieved
   - Call to action (GitHub link)
